## Web Assignment

The code in this assignment has been mostly writted from scratch, but the instructions for the user login system has been taken from https://github.com/PrettyPrinted/building_user_login_system . The code from there has been refactored to suit the needs and then lots of other code has been written to give the desired functions of this assignment. Some of bells and whistles that have been added are. 

Make sure you unpack the project in the directory like C:/CS162/flaskr/flaskr (this is where the db URI is in the code)
If you run into problems with the db, you might have to change the URI of the db from app.py since the format of writing the URI is different in windows vs mac vs linux.
